# Open Walking Tour

## The idea behind the App
Walk around town and use this app as your Virtual Tour Guide. Anytime you walk near a hotspot the app will automatically play you a description of what your are seeing. 

## Try out 
https://open-walking-tour.vercel.app/hotspots

### Note 
You must have Geolocation enabled on your mobile browser. The app will not have it's core functionality without GPS. 
For iOS this is done by enabling in your browser settings, but also in your general phone settings. 


## Open source hotspots

Note that there are currently only GPS tags for Brooklyn and Marseille. We are happy to add tags and the app should make it easy to do so. Anyone can add hotspots to the application

## What's next for OWT?

### AutoPlay
Enable auto play so that hotspots play as you walk around and change your GPS coordinates.

### ChatGPT integration
Hook up to ChatGPT to automatically produce new hotspot descriptions for new cities. ChatGPT will also create a narrative to your specific liking. For example if you are a child, or a College Student, or senior citizen.
