## The idea behind the example

Note that there are currently only GPS tags for Brooklyn and Marseille. We are happy to add tags and the app should make it easy to do so. 

## What's next?

Getting the project online with vercel or Netlify. 
Get it on Next.js
Enable sound, as you move to different GPS coordinates.
